# Kriti Tiwari - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hey there! 
I’m Kriti, a curious data enthusiast who loves diving into datasets and uncovering meaningful insights. Whether it’s working with SQL, Excel, or visualizing data with Power BI, I enjoy turning numbers into stories that help make data-driven decisions.

Throughout my journey in data analysis, I’ve explored various projects—from sales trends to customer behavior—each offering unique challenges and learning opportunities. I believe that great data analysis isn’t just about the numbers, but about the stories they tell.

Outside of data, I enjoy learning new tools, staying updated on industry trends, and connecting with fellow data lovers. Let’s collaborate and create something amazing together!

You can peek at my resume [here](Kriti_Tiwari_DA.pdf). It’s like my data journey in a nutshell!
